Up in the hills, the tea estates of Munnar roll out in every shade of green and the air turns cool and clean. Down on the coast, Fort Kochi blends Portuguese churches, Chinese fishing nets and old spice warehouses into something wholly its own. Add a Kathakali performance, a plate of Keralan seafood and an Ayurvedic massage, and the appeal becomes obvious.
